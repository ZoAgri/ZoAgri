Zo Agri Business Solution- empowering the farmers of Mizoram by encouraging cultivation of protein and Omega 3 rich crop, sacha inchi.
With an idea to make available protein-sufficient food for vegetarians and vegans, a startup from the capital city of Mizoram, Zo Agri Business Solution, started engaging in the cultivation of a high protein-yielding crop- Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia Volubilis).  As majority of farmers in Mizoram grow maize and rice, its founder- Melvyn Vanlalhlimpuia, embarked on a transformative journey by providing comprehensive training to the farmers of Mizoram on cultivating sacha Inchi. Started in 2016, today, Zo Agri Business Solution has successfully trained and empowered over 300 sacha inchi growers across the state, transitioning them from farmers to sancha inchi sellers. Using the seeds and leaves procured from their trained farmers itself, the startup manufactures various products made from sacha inchi (seeds and leaves), like roasted seeds, green tea, oil and oil soap. Recently, the startup has collaborated with Mizoram University for developing sacha inchi oil emulsion. 
Though we have various items in our product. These are available now, Roasted Sacha Inchi seeds, Sacha Inchi tea, Sacha Inchi oil and Sacha Inchi oil soap. And we are going to have new product, such as Sacha Inchi protein powder and Sacha Inchi oil emulsion.
